- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Prasanna. My friends call me Pras, Prezi or sometimes the man who is overly ambitious.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new things and always pushing the boundaries. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing my MSc in Business Analytics at Aston University. In addition, I also have a Masters in Mechanical Engineering from UCL. I'm in the process of learning Data Science, Machine Learning and AI concepts in the hopes of bringing these technologies closer to the general consumer.

- I will be using this space to upload some Personal Projects that I will be working on through the years.
